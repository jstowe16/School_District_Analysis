# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
Following notification from the school board of academic dishonesty, the math and reading scores from the 9th Grade Thomas High School (THS) have been the school district analysis have been removed from the dataset. The school district analysis evaluating performance based on per student spending ranges, school size and school type has been revised accordingly. 

## Results
The seven performance metrics were unaffected by the change based on the removal of the 9th grade THS scores. Further discussion is in the section below. 

### School Summary
The school summary prior to removing the ineligible THS 9th grade scores is shown in the image below.

After removing the 9th grade THS math and reading scores, there was insignificant change to the overall THS performance. The percentage of students passing math went from 93.3% to 93.2%, reading from 97.3% to 97.0% and overall from 90.9% to 90.6%. The outcome from the update analysis is in the image below for comparison.

### Overall Performance Comparisons
Similar to the school summary, and due to the minor change in the THS performance, the outcomes by school spending, size and type are relatively unaffected.

## Recommendations
It is recommended to verify the data sources for the school district performance analysis. The primary outcome, that there is no significant change when considering the 9th grade THS scores removal, is unexpected and seemingly unlikely. Further work is required to confirm the data source has not already been modified to capture the THS issues.
